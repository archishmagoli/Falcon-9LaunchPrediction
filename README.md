# SpaceXLaunchPrediction
## Introduction
In this project, I accomplished the following:
- Extracted datasets through an open-source **SpaceX REST API** and used **web scraping** with Python's **BeautifulSoup** to gather additional historical data on SpaceX launch and landing proceedings from 2010 to 2020.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis through SQL, Matplotlib, and Pandas.
- Created visualizations using **Folium** and generated an interactive analytical dashboard of results with Pythonâ€™s **Plotly** and **Dash** frameworks.
- Trained **three different machine learning models** (Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, and SVM) and analyzed which would be the most accurate at predicting whether a given launch would land the first stage successfully.
- Generated a [sample stakeholder report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mKddFqZFriQnDtG0Hwblvcj-6O_pqPzG/view?usp=sharing) with important conclusions and visualizations generated from overall data analytics and visualizations.

Overall, it was determined that across 2010-2020, approximately **two-thirds** of all SpaceX launches typically landed their first stages successfully.

This project was completed as part of the **Applied Data Science Capstone** course in the **IBM Data Science Certification.**
